                                On the consulting side, I've helped industry
                                leaders across hospitality, retail, and CPG turn
                                dormant assets into products. On the brand side,
                                I've done the same thing from the inside,
                                managing budgets, competing priorities, legacy
                                systems, and quarterly targets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That combination means I can spot the growth
                                hiding inside an organization and actually ship
                                it. I specialize in turning under-leveraged
                                assets into products and platforms that create
                                customer value. Data sitting in silos, processes
                                that could be productized, partner networks that
                                aren't connected to anything. I find those
                                opportunities, build the connective tissue, and
                                apply AI where it actually moves the needle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've built conversational platforms, enterprise
                                personalization engines, API integration layers
                                from the ground up, and much more. I've led
                                AI-driven product work years before the current
                                wave and created practices around it that scaled
                                across multiple clients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                None of this happens alone. I build teams that
                                can move at the pace of the market, develop
                                talent, and collaborate across product,
                                engineering, design, and data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where most executives get 2-3 big swings in a
                                decade, I've seen 20-30. That pattern
                                recognition is what I bring to the table.

                                I'm always up for connecting with people
                                thinking about product innovation, platform
                                strategy, or unlocking growth from existing
                                assets. Reach out if any of that resonates.
