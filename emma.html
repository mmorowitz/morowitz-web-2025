                        <p>
                            Under my leadership, R/GA's Brand AI team designed,
                            concepted and developed the Epic Mountain Assistant
                            for Vail Resorts, the world's first digital mountain
                            assistant to provide real-time information to skiers
                            and snowboarders.

                            From planning a ski vacation to arrival and all the
                            way through departure, Emma offers guests an
                            unprecedented breadth of information tailored to
                            each resort. Emma's got you covered on topics such
                            as snow conditions and lift line wait times,
                            parking, ski school, lift tickets and equipment
                            rental options, on- and off-mountain dining and
                            activities recommendations and more. Plus, the more
                            you ask her, the more she learns and the smarter she
                            gets.

                        <p>
                            Guests at any of the Vail Resorts properties often
                            face a variety of challenges that stand between them
                            and the slopes. My team at R/GA was contracted to
                            create an AI-powered chatbot designed to connect
                            guests with the variety of distributed digital
                            resources at over a dozen different resorts.

                            Pre LLMs, we used a combination of natural language
                            processing NLP tools and legacy API integrations to
                            build a chatbot with a wealth of data access.
